# NeetCode DSA – Java Solutions

This repository contains my **Java solutions** to problems from the [NeetCode DSA Roadmap](https://neetcode.io/roadmap).  
Each solution includes clean code, brief comments, and tests written with **JUnit 5**.

The goal of this project is to practice data structures and algorithms in a structured, testable, and scalable way.

## What's Included?

-  Java code written with focus on readability
-  Solutions organized by DSA topic (arrays, stack, etc.)
-  Unit tests using **JUnit 5**
-  Maven-based project (standard Java structure)
-  No `main()` methods — all executions are done through tests


## How to Run Tests?

Make sure you have **Java 17+** and **Maven** installed.

Then run all tests from terminal:

```bash
mvn test
